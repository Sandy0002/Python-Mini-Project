<a id="intro"></a><h2>About</h2>
This is the most beginner friendly language. This high level language is very vast. The language is so vast that it can be used to build programs ranging from day to day execution scripts to advanced softwares such as artificial intellgience and game development etc. Since it has a very large codebase and community support it is preferred to begin with. The main intention behind build python was **code readability** and **rapid application developments**.


<a id="applications"></a><h2>Applications</h2>
There might be very few people who are programmers and not aware of its applications. The list is pretty long but to mention few here is a brief list: 

+ Web Applications
+ Game Development
+ Audio and Video Applications
+ Data Science
+ Artificial Intelligence

<a id="gameDemo"></a><h2>Game Demo</h2>

Here I have made a program that use **tkinter** library to build a classic game tic-tac-toe.Coordinates of the screen were used to build the interface. In this each grid consists of 2 buttons z<sub>i</sub> denoting for **zero** and c<sub>i</sub> denoting for **cross** for the i<sup>th</sup> grid.

Simply download and run this [code](https://github.com/Sandy0002/Python-Mini-Project/blob/main/Game/tic-tac-toe.py) in your IDE and it will work.

<a id="webApps"></a><h2>Web Applications</h2>

Python is a very powerful tool for building production level web applications. It consists quite resourceful frameworks such as **Django** and **Flask**. \
Just to show how easy and how quickly we can build we apps. Checkout this [code](https://github.com/Sandy0002/Python-Mini-Project/blob/main/Web%20Apps/Streamlit/bmi_calculator/code.py)

Here is a demo picture of what it looks like. Here this web application is made with streamlit to measure **Body Mass Index**

<a id="advance"></a><h2>Advance Programs</h2>
As we have seen how easy it is to build programs with python we can build very large projects easily with python such as machine learning, deep learning, desktop applications or games. They are useful to build virtual assistants as well. Checkout my machine learning and deep learning exercises repository that consists of these kinds of programs.
