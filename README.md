<a id="intro"></a><h2>About</h2>
This is the most beginner friendly language. This high level language is very vast. The language is so vast that it can be used to build programs ranging from day to day execution scripts to advanced softwares such as artificial intellgience and game development etc. Since it has a very large codebase and community support it is preferred to begin with. The main intention behind build python was **code readability** and **rapid application developments**.


<a id="applications"></a><h2>Applications</h2>
There might be very few people who are programmers and not aware of its applications. The list is pretty long but to mention few here is a brief list: 

+ Web Applications
+ Game Development
+ Audio and Video Applications
+ Data Science
+ Artificial Intelligence


<a id="gameDemo"></a><h2>Game Demo</h2>

Here I have made a program that use **tkinter** library to build a classic game tic-tac-toe.Coordinates of the screen were used to build the interface. In this each grid consists of 2 buttons z<sub>i</sub> denoting for **zero** and c<sub>i</sub> denoting for **cross** for the i<sup>th</sup> grid.
